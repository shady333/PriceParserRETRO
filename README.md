# PriceParserRETRO

A Python-based web scraper designed to extract car price data from [retromagaz.com](https://retromagaz.com) and store it in a CSV file. The script categorizes items (e.g., Hot Wheels, Matchbox) based on price thresholds and supports parallel processing for efficiency.

## Features
- Scrapes car prices from multiple pages on retromagaz.com.
- Categorizes items into types (e.g., Premium, RLC, MainLine) with configurable price thresholds.
- Saves data to `car_prices.csv` with daily price updates.
- Tracks progress in `progress.txt` to resume from the last parsed page.
- Uses multi-threading for faster page processing.
- Integrates with GitHub Actions for automated daily scraping at 08:00 CEST.

- PAGES_PER_DAY: Limits scraping to 40 pages per day (adjustable).
- SAVE_INTERVAL: Saves CSV every 5 pages (adjustable).
- MAX_WORKERS: Uses 10 threads for parallel processing (adjustable).
